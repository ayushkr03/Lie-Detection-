# Lie-Detection
This repository deals with Deception Detection using Audio Classification 
The main objective of this project is to use the verbal/speech modalities to detect
deception adopted by humans. The implementation of the deep learning methods will
surely outperform the human capabilities to identify deceit.

The most innovative part of our project is the type of data used i.e. audio/speech. If we use
video data then it can lead to racial profiling and numerous other physical biases which will
give us numerous false positives and negatives. It also makes collection of data easier and
more uniform and is able to include and adapt to more outliers. Moreover, in case of video
data, too many different dependencies like angle, lighting, etc. come into picture which can
skew the data.

The modules in the project are as follows:
• IMPORTING DATA
• CONVERTING TO SPECTOGRAM
• CONVERTING TO MFCC
• CLEANING AND AUGMENTATION OF DATA
• BUILDING NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
• TRAINING NETWORK ARCHITECTURE ON DATA
• DECIDING EVALUATION METRICS AND TESTING
